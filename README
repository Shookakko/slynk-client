A Common Lisp implementation of the client side of the Slime Swank debugging
protocol.  Emacs uses the Swank protocol to communicate with a Lisp system when
the user runs the Slime IDE.

The protocol is useful independently of Emacs because it allows the client to
evaluate expressions on the Swank server.

Swank Client implements the following API.  For more information, see
the documentation strings in the code.

swank-connection        The object representing a Swank connection.
slime-connect           Connect to a remote Common Lisp using the Swank protocol.
slime-close             Close a Swank connection.
slime-eval              Evaluate an expression on a remote Lisp.
slime-eval-async        Evaluate an expression on a remote Lisp asynchronously.
slime-migrate-evals     Migrate work pending on one Swank connection to another.
slime-network-error     The condition that represents a network error.
slime-pending-evals-p   Does a Swank connection have unfinished work pending?
